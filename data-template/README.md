=======================

<!-- NOTE:
This is an example README.md file to serve as a template for documenting data.

Guidelines for storing data on the PetaLibrary:

- all data must be documented with a README or equivalent
- treat all data as if they will be published
- undocumented data are subject to deletion

Conventions for file naming:

- use a convention!
- our preference is pothole_case
- do not mix CamelCase_and_pothole_case
- use a standard date format such as ISO 8601 (e.g., 2016-03-20)

Conventions for file formats:

- avoid proprietary file formats, e.g.,
  - GeoTIFF instead of ESRI grid
  - GeoJSON instead of ESRI shapefile
  - csv instead of xlsx
  - SQLite instead of Microsoft Access
