# Welcome to the Earth Lab PetaLibrary space!

This document outlines guidelines for using the Earth Lab PetaLibrary space.
The PetaLibrary is a shared resource intended to act as a storage space for large data sets.


## The Golden Rule

**Treat all data on the PetaLibrary as if it will be published.**

This implies that you maintain documentation, metadata, and an organizational scheme for each data directory.
Directories that are undocumented are subject to deletion.
