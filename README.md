Earth Lab PetaLibrary training materials
========================================

This repository contains templates for data and project directories, as well as a top-level README that will exist in `/work/earthlab/` on the CU Boulder Research Computing [PetaLibary](https://www.rc.colorado.edu/resources/storage/petalibrary).

These resources were compiled by Maxwell Joseph (CU Boulder, Earth Lab), Shelley Knuth (CU Boulder, Research Computing), and Andrew Johnson (CU Boulder, Libraries) to facilitate training activities and responsible use of the shared PetaLibrary resources.
